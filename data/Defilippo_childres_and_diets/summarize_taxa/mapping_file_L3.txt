The pellets were dissolved in 1 mL ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 700 ?? g at 4 ?C for 1 min. The supernatants were transferred into a 15-mL tube and were centrifuged at 9,000 ?? g at 4 ?C for 5 min. Subsequently, the pellets were suspended in 2.8 mL TE buffer by repeated pipetting. Then 180 _L SDS 10% (wt/vol) and 18 _L of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) were added. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 ?C. Afterward, 20 _L RNase (40 _g/mL) was added and incubated at RT for 5 min. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (50:50) was added, and the samples were shaken well until the phases were completely mixed. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4500 ?? g for 2 min. The upper layers were then transferred into a new tube. This step was repeated again so that the interface of the two layers was clean. Next, 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and two volumes 96% ethanol were added and mixed gently. The mixtures were stored overnight at _20 ?C to precipitate the genomic DNA, and then the samples were centrifuged at 4 ?C at 9,000 ?? g for 10 min. The precipitated genomic DNA was washed twice in 1 mL 70% ethanol. Finally, dried samples were suspended in 200_400 _L H2O. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry measuring OD 260/280. Only samples with good DNA quality were processed. Extracted DNA was stored at _20 ?C. For each sample, we amplified 16S rRNA genes using a primer set corresponding to primers 784F and 1061R. These PCR primers target the V5 and V6 16S rRNA region. The forward primer contained the sequence of the Titanium A adaptor (5_-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3_) and a barcode sequence. For each sample, a PCR mix of 100 _L was prepared containing 1?? PCR buffer, 5U of FastStart High Fidelity polymerase blend and dNTPs from the FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche), 200 nM primers (Eurogentec), and 100 ng gDNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 95 ?C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 ?C for 40 s, annealing at 55 ?C for 40 s, and extension at 72 ?C for 1 min, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 ?C. Amplicons were visualized on 1.0% agarose gels using SYBR Safe DNA gel stain in 0.5??

The supernatants were transferred into a 15-mL tube and were centrifuged at 9,000 ?? g at 4 ?C for 5 min. Subsequently, the pellets were suspended in 2.8 mL TE buffer by repeated pipetting. Then 180 _L SDS 10% (wt/vol) and 18 _L of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) were added. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 ?C. Afterward, 20 _L RNase (40 _g/mL) was added and incubated at RT for 5 min. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (50:50) was added, and the samples were shaken well until the phases were completely mixed. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4500 ?? g for 2 min. The upper layers were then transferred into a new tube. This step was repeated again so that the interface of the two layers was clean. Next, 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and two volumes 96% ethanol were added and mixed gently. The mixtures were stored overnight at _20 ?C to precipitate the genomic DNA, and then the samples were centrifuged at 4 ?C at 9,000 ?? g for 10 min. The precipitated genomic DNA was washed twice in 1 mL 70% ethanol. Finally, dried samples were suspended in 200_400 _L H2O. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry measuring OD 260/280. Only samples with good DNA quality were processed. Extracted DNA was stored at _20 ?C. For each sample, we amplified 16S rRNA genes using a primer set corresponding to primers 784F and 1061R. These PCR primers target the V5 and V6 16S rRNA region. The forward primer contained the sequence of the Titanium A adaptor (5_-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3_) and a barcode sequence. For each sample, a PCR mix of 100 _L was prepared containing 1?? PCR buffer, 5U of FastStart High Fidelity polymerase blend and dNTPs from the FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche), 200 nM primers (Eurogentec), and 100 ng gDNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 95 ?C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 ?C for 40 s, annealing at 55 ?C for 40 s, and extension at 72 ?C for 1 min, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 ?C. Amplicons were visualized on 1.0% agarose gels using SYBR Safe DNA gel stain in 0.5?? TBE (Invitrogen) and were cleaned using the HighPure Cleanup kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer?s instructions.	12.24	Impact of diet in shaping gut microbiota revealed by a comparative study in children from Europe and rural Africa	0	University of Florence, Italy	Impact of diet in shaping gut microbiota revealed by a comparative study in children from Europe and rural Africa	0.0	0.803370786517	0.157303370787	0.0	0.0393258426966	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.803370786517	0.0	0.157303370787	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0393258426966	0.0	0.0	0.0

Then 180 _L SDS 10% (wt/vol) and 18 _L of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) were added. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 ?C. Afterward, 20 _L RNase (40 _g/mL) was added and incubated at RT for 5 min. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (50:50) was added, and the samples were shaken well until the phases were completely mixed. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4500 ?? g for 2 min. The upper layers were then transferred into a new tube. This step was repeated again so that the interface of the two layers was clean. Next, 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and two volumes 96% ethanol were added and mixed gently. The mixtures were stored overnight at _20 ?C to precipitate the genomic DNA, and then the samples were centrifuged at 4 ?C at 9,000 ?? g for 10 min. The precipitated genomic DNA was washed twice in 1 mL 70% ethanol. Finally, dried samples were suspended in 200_400 _L H2O. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry measuring OD 260/280. Only samples with good DNA quality were processed. Extracted DNA was stored at _20 ?C. For each sample, we amplified 16S rRNA genes using a primer set corresponding to primers 784F and 1061R. These PCR primers target the V5 and V6 16S rRNA region. The forward primer contained the sequence of the Titanium A adaptor (5_-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3_) and a barcode sequence. For each sample, a PCR mix of 100 _L was prepared containing 1?? PCR buffer, 5U of FastStart High Fidelity polymerase blend and dNTPs from the FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche), 200 nM primers (Eurogentec), and 100 ng gDNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 95 ?C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 ?C for 40 s, annealing at 55 ?C for 40 s, and extension at 72 ?C for 1 min, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 ?C.

The pellets were dissolved in 1 mL ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 700 ?? g at 4 ?C for 1 min. The supernatants were transferred into a 15-mL tube and were centrifuged at 9,000 ?? g at 4 ?C for 5 min. Subsequently, the pellets were suspended in 2.8 mL TE buffer by repeated pipetting. Then 180 _L SDS 10% (wt/vol) and 18 _L of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) were added. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 ?C. Afterward, 20 _L RNase (40 _g/mL) was added and incubated at RT for 5 min. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (50:50) was added, and the samples were shaken well until the phases were completely mixed. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4500 ?? g for 2 min. The upper layers were then transferred into a new tube. This step was repeated again so that the interface of the two layers was clean. Next, 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and two volumes 96% ethanol were added and mixed gently. The mixtures were stored overnight at _20 ?C to precipitate the genomic DNA, and then the samples were centrifuged at 4 ?C at 9,000 ?? g for 10 min. The precipitated genomic DNA was washed twice in 1 mL 70% ethanol. Finally, dried samples were suspended in 200_400 _L H2O. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry measuring OD 260/280. Only samples with good DNA quality were processed. Extracted DNA was stored at _20 ?C. For each sample, we amplified 16S rRNA genes using a primer set corresponding to primers 784F and 1061R. These PCR primers target the V5 and V6 16S rRNA region. The forward primer contained the sequence of the Titanium A adaptor (5_-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3_) and a barcode sequence. For each sample, a PCR mix of 100 _L was prepared containing 1?? PCR buffer, 5U of FastStart High Fidelity polymerase blend and dNTPs from the FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche), 200 nM primers (Eurogentec), and 100 ng gDNA.

The upper layers were then transferred into a new tube. This step was repeated again so that the interface of the two layers was clean. Next, 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and two volumes 96% ethanol were added and mixed gently. The mixtures were stored overnight at _20 ?C to precipitate the genomic DNA, and then the samples were centrifuged at 4 ?C at 9,000 ?? g for 10 min. The precipitated genomic DNA was washed twice in 1 mL 70% ethanol. Finally, dried samples were suspended in 200_400 _L H2O. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry measuring OD 260/280. Only samples with good DNA quality were processed. Extracted DNA was stored at _20 ?C. For each sample, we amplified 16S rRNA genes using a primer set corresponding to primers 784F and 1061R. These PCR primers target the V5 and V6 16S rRNA region. The forward primer contained the sequence of the Titanium A adaptor (5_-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-3_) and a barcode sequence. For each sample, a PCR mix of 100 _L was prepared containing 1?? PCR buffer, 5U of FastStart High Fidelity polymerase blend and dNTPs from the FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche), 200 nM primers (Eurogentec), and 100 ng gDNA. Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 95 ?C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 ?C for 40 s, annealing at 55 ?C for 40 s, and extension at 72 ?C for 1 min, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 ?C. Amplicons were visualized on 1.0% agarose gels using SYBR Safe DNA gel stain in 0.5?? TBE (Invitrogen) and were cleaned using the HighPure Cleanup kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer?s instructions.	43.57	Impact of diet in shaping gut microbiota revealed by a comparative study in children from Europe and rural Africa	0	University of Florence, Italy	Impact of diet in shaping gut microbiota revealed by a comparative study in children from Europe and rural Africa	0.0116618075802	0.262390670554	0.31195335277	0.0	0.413994169096	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0116618075802	0.262390670554	0.0379008746356	0.274052478134	0.0	0.0	0.00583090379009	0.0	0.408163265306	0.0	0.0	0.0

We compared the fecal microbiota and the metabolome of 15 European children (EU) with that of 14 children from a rural African village (Burkina Faso, BF), where the diet is pretty much the same as that of early human settlements at the time of the birth of agriculture. The 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of BF microbiota showed significant enrichment in Bacteroidetes and depletion in Firmicutes, hypothesizing a coevolution with BF children's polysaccharide-rich diet, allowing them to maximize energy intake from indigestible components. The correlation between diet, differences in microbiota and production of short-chain fatty acids important for gut health presented are the first comparison between human western and ancestral intestinal microflora.	human gut metagenome	Healthy	UBERON:feces	pyrosequencing	408170	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	5	University of Florence, Italy	Natural childbirth	FWD:CRRCACGAGCTGACGAC;REV:AGGATTAGATACCCTGGTA	After dissolving _500 mg of each fecal sample in physiological solution and homogenization by vigorous hand shaking, 600 _L suspension was centrifuged (10,000 ?? g for 10 min at 4 ?C) to obtain pellets.
