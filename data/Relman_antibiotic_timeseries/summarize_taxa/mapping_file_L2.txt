PCR amplicon libraries were gel puri_ed, quanti_ed using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) in 96-well plates on a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare), pooled in equal ratios by mass, and submitted for pyrosequencing.	37.42	antibiotic_perturbation	0	Stanford_University	Incomplete recovery and individualized responses of the human distal gut microbiota to repeated antibiotic perturbation	0.0	0.0	0.602852776363	0.0	0.23138053999	0.0	0.0	0.00193581253184	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.163830871116
