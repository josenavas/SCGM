Controls treated identically but lacking fecal material uniformly failed to produce detectable bands after PCR and gel electrophoresis. PCR ampli_cation of a region of the small subunit rRNA (16S rRNA) gene was performed with 50 ng or 5 ng template DNA (Nanodrop) in 50 _L reactions as described (Roche). Fusion primers adapted for the general sequencing kit of the GS FLX Titanium pyrosequencing platform (Roche) comprised of A linker_10-mer barcode_dinucleotide spacer_533_515R reverse primer (proximal primer) or B linker_dinucleotide spacer_8_27F forward primer (distal primer). (Forward and reverse refer to 16S rRNA orientation; sequencing was from the A-linked proximal toward the B-linked distal primer.) Spacers were chosen to match few or no dinucleotides adjacent to the priming site (with reference to public 16S rRNA databases) to interrupt chance complementarity with the barcode or linker. PCR amplicon libraries were gel puri_ed, quanti_ed using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) in 96-well plates on a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare), pooled in equal ratios by mass, and submitted for pyrosequencing.	37.42	antibiotic_perturbation	0	Stanford_University	Incomplete recovery and individualized responses of the human distal gut microbiota to repeated antibiotic perturbation	0.0	0.000744803304218	0.643713183018	0.0	0.347349177331	0.0	0.0	0.00555217008599	0.0	0.0	0.00027083756517	0.00236982869524	0.0	0.000744803304218	0.643713183018	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.000609384521633	0.346739792809	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.00467194799919	0.0	0.0	0.000880222086803	0.0	0.0	0.00027083756517	0.0	0.0	0.00236982869524
