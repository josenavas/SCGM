The genomic DNA from the atherosclerotic plaque samples was extracted using the MOBIO PowerSoil DNA isolation kit. All samples were extensively homogenized using a bead beater at maximum speed for 3 minutes. The remaining steps were performed as directed by the manufacturer.16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with a forward primer containing the 454 Life Sciences primer B sequence and the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F,and a reverse primer containing the 454 Life Sciences primer A sequence, a unique 12-nucleotide error-correcting barcode used to tag each PCR product, and the broad-range bacterial primer 338R. PCR reactions were carried out in quadruplicate (gut, oral) or triplicate (atherosclerotic plaques) 20 _l reactions with 0.3 _M forward and reverse primers, with approximately 50 ng template DNA, and 1X of HotStar Taq Plus Master Mix kit (Qiagen). Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 95?C for 2 minutes followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95?C for 20 seconds, annealing at 52?C for 20 seconds, and extension at 65?C for 60 seconds. Replicate amplicons were pooled, purified with Agencourt AMPure kit (Agencourt), and visualized by electrophoresis using 1.0% agarose gels. Negative extraction control samples were treated similarly except that no template DNA was added to the PCR reactions: these failed to produce visible PCR products and were not analyzed further. Oral and fecal amplicon DNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop), and atherosclerotic plaque amplicons DNAs were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube with a final concentration of 16 ng/_l. Pyrosequencing of oral and fecal samples was carried on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument at Center for Metagenomic Sequence Analysis at KTH, School of Biotechnology in Stockholm, Sweden, and atherosclerotic plaque samples were sequenced at the Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center using Roche/454 Titanium chemistry."
