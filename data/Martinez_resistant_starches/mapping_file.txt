Cells were recovered by centrifugation (8,000_g for 5 min at room temperature) and suspended in ice-cold PBS to wash the cells. This step was repeated twice before cell pellets were suspended in 100 ?l of lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, 20 mM EDTA, 20 mg/ml Lysozyme, pH 8.0) containing 20 mg/ml of Lysozyme and incubated at 37?C for half an hour. Buffer ASL (1.6 ml) from QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was added to each sample, after which the samples were homogenized in a MiniBeadbeater-8 for 2 min at maximum speed. 1.2 ml of supernatant was used to purify DNA with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal DNA. The 16S primers were modified to work with the Roche-454 Titanium adapter sequences and contain the A or B Titanium sequencing adapter (shown in italics), followed immediately by a unique 8-base barcode sequence (BBBBBBBB) and finally the 5_ end of primer. A mixture (4:1) of the primers B-8FM (5_- CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGAGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG?3_) and B-8FMBifido (5_-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGAGGGTTCGATTCTGGCTCAG?3_) were used as the forward primer during PCR. As the reverse primer, the primer A-518R (5_- CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGBBBBBBBBATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG ?3_) was used. Individual samples were amplified with primers containing unique barcodes, which allowed the mixing of PCR products from multiple samples in a single run, followed by bioinformatic assignation of the sequences to their respective samples via the barcode. Primer 8FMBifido was used in combination with primer 8FM to detect bifidobacteria, as species within this genus do not match the latter primer. The PCR mixture contained 1 ?l of forward primer mix, 1 ?l of reverse primer, 0.25 ?l of Ex-Taq polymerase, 1.5 ?l of the sample, 6.25 ?l of Ex-Taq buffer, 5 ?l of deoxynucleotides and 37 ?l of sterile dH2O were used for the reaction. The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturing step for 5 min at 95?C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95?C for 45 sec, annealing at 57?C for 45 sec and extension at 72?C for 2 min, with a final step at 72?C for 10 min. The PCR products were quantified based on their staining intensity using the image acquisition software Genesnap. PCR products were combined in equal amounts and gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Pyrosequencing was performed by the Core for Applied Genomics and Ecology (CAGE, University of Nebraska) from the A end with the 454/Roche A sequencing primer kit using a Roche Genome Sequencer GS-FLX following manufacturer's protocol for the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium.	40.81	PMID: 21151517	0	University of Nebraska	Resistant Starches Types 2 and 4 Have Differential Effects on the Composition of the Fecal Microbiota in Human Subjects

Buffer ASL (1.6 ml) from QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was added to each sample, after which the samples were homogenized in a MiniBeadbeater-8 for 2 min at maximum speed. 1.2 ml of supernatant was used to purify DNA with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal DNA. The 16S primers were modified to work with the Roche-454 Titanium adapter sequences and contain the A or B Titanium sequencing adapter (shown in italics), followed immediately by a unique 8-base barcode sequence (BBBBBBBB) and finally the 5_ end of primer.

Buffer ASL (1.6 ml) from QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was added to each sample, after which the samples were homogenized in a MiniBeadbeater-8 for 2 min at maximum speed. 1.2 ml of supernatant was used to purify DNA with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal DNA.

Buffer ASL (1.6 ml) from QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was added to each sample, after which the samples were homogenized in a MiniBeadbeater-8 for 2 min at maximum speed. 1.2 ml of supernatant was used to purify DNA with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal DNA. The 16S primers were modified to work with the Roche-454 Titanium adapter sequences and contain the A or B Titanium sequencing adapter (shown in italics), followed immediately by a unique 8-base barcode sequence (BBBBBBBB) and finally the 5_ end of primer.

Individual samples were amplified with primers containing unique barcodes, which allowed the mixing of PCR products from multiple samples in a single run, followed by bioinformatic assignation of the sequences to their respective samples via the barcode. Primer 8FMBifido was used in combination with primer 8FM to detect bifidobacteria, as species within this genus do not match the latter primer.

Buffer ASL (1.6 ml) from QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was added to each sample, after which the samples were homogenized in a MiniBeadbeater-8 for 2 min at maximum speed. 1.2 ml of supernatant was used to purify DNA with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal DNA.

Cells were recovered by centrifugation (8,000_g for 5 min at room temperature) and suspended in ice-cold PBS to wash the cells. This step was repeated twice before cell pellets were suspended in 100 ?l of lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, 20 mM EDTA, 20 mg/ml Lysozyme, pH 8.0) containing 20 mg/ml of Lysozyme and incubated at 37?C for half an hour. Buffer ASL (1.6 ml) from QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was added to each sample, after which the samples were homogenized in a MiniBeadbeater-8 for 2 min at maximum speed. 1.2 ml of supernatant was used to purify DNA with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal DNA. The 16S primers were modified to work with the Roche-454 Titanium adapter sequences and contain the A or B Titanium sequencing adapter (shown in italics), followed immediately by a unique 8-base barcode sequence (BBBBBBBB) and finally the 5_ end of primer. A mixture (4:1) of the primers B-8FM (5_- CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGAGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG?3_) and B-8FMBifido (5_-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGAGGGTTCGATTCTGGCTCAG?3_) were used as the forward primer during PCR. As the reverse primer, the primer A-518R (5_- CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGBBBBBBBBATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG ?3_) was used. Individual samples were amplified with primers containing unique barcodes, which allowed the mixing of PCR products from multiple samples in a single run, followed by bioinformatic assignation of the sequences to their respective samples via the barcode. Primer 8FMBifido was used in combination with primer 8FM to detect bifidobacteria, as species within this genus do not match the latter primer. The PCR mixture contained 1 ?l of forward primer mix, 1 ?l of reverse primer, 0.25 ?l of Ex-Taq polymerase, 1.5 ?l of the sample, 6.25 ?l of Ex-Taq buffer, 5 ?l of deoxynucleotides and 37 ?l of sterile dH2O were used for the reaction. The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturing step for 5 min at 95?C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95?C for 45 sec, annealing at 57?C for 45 sec and extension at 72?C for 2 min, with a final step at 72?C for 10 min. The PCR products were quantified based on their staining intensity using the image acquisition software Genesnap. PCR products were combined in equal amounts and gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Pyrosequencing was performed by the Core for Applied Genomics and Ecology (CAGE, University of Nebraska) from the A end with the 454/Roche A sequencing primer kit using a Roche Genome Sequencer GS-FLX following manufacturer's protocol for the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium.	40.81	PMID: 21151587	0	University of Nebraska	Resistant Starches Types 2 and 4 Have Differential Effects on the Composition of the Fecal Microbiota in Human Subjects
